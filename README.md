Rules: 
- The game is played in rounds between two players
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as desired. Each result gets added to a round score
- If the player rolls a 1, the round score gets lost (0). The next player then proceeds
- If a player chooses to 'Hold', the current round score gets added to the player's total score. The next player proceeds
- The first player to reach 100 points on their total score wins the game
